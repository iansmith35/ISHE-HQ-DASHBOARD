## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric cyan (#7DF9FF) for a modern, high-tech feel.  The choice of an electric cyan aligns with the prompt's explicit request for a neon UI, but offers some freedom, preventing an overly generic look.
- Background color: Dark gray (#121212) for a dark-themed neon aesthetic. This ensures the neon colors pop.
- Accent color: Lime green (#32CD32) for interactive elements and highlights.  Lime contrasts very well with electric cyan to provide accent and focus to key parts of the interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy, modern feel.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets.
- Lucide icons with neon styling to match the overall theme.
- Dark background with neon accents; floating assistant avatar.
- Motion-reduced animations for accessibility; subtle animations on data updates and AI responses.
