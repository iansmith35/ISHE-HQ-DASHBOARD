Ensure your `.env.local` contains:
```bash

```

### 3. Test the Integration

node scripts/test-dashboard-updates.js
```

### 4. Deploy to Firebase
```bash
npm run build  # Note: Currently fails due to AI dependencies
firebase deploy
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Firebase App Hosting (Recommended)
The app is pre-configured for Firebase App Hosting:

1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
3. Deploy: `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### Option 2: Node.js Server
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Start production server: `npm start`
3. Application will be available on port 3000

### Option 3: Static Export (if needed)
Add to `next.config.ts`:
```typescript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: { unoptimized: true }
}
```

## Environment Variables
Currently, the application runs without external environment variables for basic functionality. 

For full AI features, you may need:
- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` - For Gemini AI integration (if not using Firebase defaults)
